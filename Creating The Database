VALUES ("Marble", "The Old Woman", "Individual","N.A", "The MET", "During the Hellenistic period, artists became concerned with the accurate representation of childhood, old age, and even physical deformity. The range of subject matter was extended to include genre-like figures from the fringes of society. Fine, large-scale statues of fishermen, peasants, and aged courtesans became valued religious dedications, sometimes placed in a park-like setting within the
sanctuary of the god. Although this statue is known familiarly as The Old Market Woman, it probably represents an aged courtesan on her way to a festival of Dionysos, the god of wine. Her delicate sandals and the ample material in her thin, elaborately draped chiton are a far cry from the rough garb of a peasant woman. The ivy wreath on her head marks her association with Dionysos, and the basket of fruit and the two chickens must be dedicatory gifts to the god or simply her own provisions for a long day of celebration. Veneration of Dionysos was widespread
during the Hellenistic period, and ancient literary descriptions give an idea of the extraordinary processions and festivals held in his honor. The flattened composition of the figure is typical of sculpture created in the late second century B.C. The original work may have been dedicated in a sanctuary of Dionysos. The Roman copy could have decorated a garden.");

The contractions and furrows in his face, especially on the forehead, reveal agony and passion. The work is known as the Artemision Jockey.");

The boxer is wearing something like todays boxing gloves, the so-called himantes. He is looking maybe to the judges expecting the result of the box fight.
As an extreme example of what was possible in the opposite direction nothing could be better than the original bronze statue ... It was found in Rome in 1885, and is essentially complete, except for the missing eyeballs; the seat is new. The statue represents a naked boxer of herculean frame, his hands armed with the aestus or boxing-gloves made of leather. He is just resting after an encounter, and no detail is spared to bring out the nature of his occupation. Swollen ears were the conventional mark of the boxer at all periods, but here the effect is still further enhanced by scratches and drops of blood. And the moustache is clotted with blood. From top to toe the statue exhibits the highest grade of technical skill. One would like very much to know what was the original purpose of the work. It may have been a votive statue, dedicated by a victorious boxer at Olympia or elsewhere. A bronze head of similar brutality found at Olympia bears witness that the refined statues of athletes produced in the best period of Greek art and set up in that precinct were forced at a later day to accept such low companionship. Or it may be that this boxer is not an actual person at all, and that the statue belongs to the domain of genre. In either case it testifies to the coarse taste of the age.");

The sculpture is considered a good example of Hellenistic art because of its dramatic characteristics.[1] The postures of the characters are exaggerated and their bodies contort in every way. Each limb is spread out in different directions, which gives the feeling that the figures are coming to life. The statue is dramatic in many ways and represents what is known as Hellenistic Baroque art. Hellenistic sculptures used three main characteristics into their work to create a more lifelike aesthetic. They did this by incorporating expressive movement, realistic anatomy, and ornate details.The fluid motion of the bodies can be seen in how the man's arm flows in a serpentine motion into the woman's arm.");
